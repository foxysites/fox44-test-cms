  The BuzzCycles crew has had a fantastic summer of riding, exploring some of
  the best routes Leighton Buzzard has to offer! We’re a friendly, inclusive
  community cycling group in Leighton Buzzard and Linslade, focused on making
  cycling easier for everyone. We believe in building confidence in a
  supportive, ‘no one left behind’ environment. It’s been great to see so many
  of you out on the road and gravel with us on our generally shorter and
  slower-paced rides, ensuring everyone feels comfortable and can enjoy the ride
  together.

Our rides have been packed with memorable moments. We enjoyed a perfect “golden hour” ride up to Mentmore with 11 riders, where the climb was absolutely worth it for the stunning views over the Vale. It’s been great to share our local knowledge, from the ancient hamlet of Clipstone, whose name hints at an Old Norse origin, to the unique history behind “The Belt” at Mentmore Parkland.

Our **Wednesday evening social rides** were a highlight, with groups of up to 14 riders enjoying the stunning “golden hour” light. We even had a brilliant ride that finished with a feast at the Cod & Waffle!

Our weekend rides were also packed with history, including a great summer picnic ride to Pitstone Windmill, one of the oldest post mills in the British Isles.

## What’s Next?

Our Wednesday evening social rides have now finished for the season, but our weekend rides will continue through the autumn and winter. We run a led ride of around 20 miles on the second Saturday of each month. Join our WhatsApp group for details of upcoming Saturday rides! We’ll be back with our regular Wednesday evening rides in April 2026.
